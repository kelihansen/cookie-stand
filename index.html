                <p>Okay, that’s not really Pat's family (they're shy), but Patrick Clark did grow up in a cozy house in Ballard where something delicious was usually baking. One year for Christmas, Pat's mom gave everyone their own cookie cutter. His sister Susan got a squirrel. Brother Larry got a moose. Pat got a salmon.</p>
                <p>His <a id="open-first-cookie" href="#">very first salmon cookies</a> were a little rough around the edges, but his fourth grade classmates enjoyed them. Over the years, Pat entertaind his friends and family with <a id="open-better-cookies" href="#">ever more creative salmon cookies</a>. One fateful day, soon after he graduated from college, Pat had an idea: What if his salmon cookies were made with actual salmon? The first batch burned, but everyone who tried the second batch demanded more. When friends of friends of friends began asking for salmon cookies, Pat realized it was time to find commercial kitchen space and share his creation with the world.</p>
